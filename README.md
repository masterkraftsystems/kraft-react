# Kraft React

**Kraft React** is a modular suite of simple, intuitive, DX-friendly libraries designed to complement the core React framework by simplifying complex patterns and enhancing developer experience. 
Developed by **Ozioma Ihekwoaba (@ozzioma)** as part of the broader **Kraft Framework**, this suite provides a cohesive set of optional, lightweight tools for state management, dependency injection, form handling, validation, and more.

Each module is designed to be incrementally adoptable, have zero or minimal third-party dependencies, and provide a simple, intuitive API that helps you build robust and maintainable React applications for any rendering environment.

## Core Philosophy

-   **Modular & Composable**: Only install what you need. Each package is small and focused on a single concern.
-   **Productivity-Focused**: Reduce boilerplate and solve common problems with intuitive, high-level APIs and hooks.
-   **Enterprise-Ready**: Built with TypeScript, dependency injection, and testability as first-class citizens.
-   **Unopinionated at Heart**: Designed to complement React, not replace its core philosophies. Use our tools alongside your favorite libraries or just the native React APIs.
